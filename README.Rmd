The 'glycoverse' is a set of packages that together form a comprehensive pipeline for glycomics and glycoproteomics data analysis.
This package is designed to make it easy to install and load multiple 'glycoverse' packages in a single step.

## Installation

You can install the latest release of glycoverse from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("glycoverse/glycoverse@*release")
```

Or install the development version:

``` r
remotes::install_github("glycoverse/glycoverse")
```

### Troubleshooting

We have scheduled to upload glycoverse packages to CRAN or Bioconductor,
but for now, many glycoverse packages (including this meta-package) can only be install from GitHub.

Installing R packages from GitHub can be tricky.
If you encounter any problem installing the packages,
google "install R package from github" might help.

Here are some common situations encountered by our colleagues:

**1. If you're using `pak` and failed.**

`pak` currently cannot handle building from source properly on some machines.
Try using `remotes::install_github()` or `devtools::install_github()`.

**2. If you're using `remotes` or `devtools` and failed.**

**2.1 Rtools not installed**

```
Could not find tools necessary to compile a package
Call `pkgbuild::check_build_tools(debug = TRUE)` to diagnose the problem.
```

It means `Rtools` is not installed.
Calling `pkgbuild::check_build_tools(debug = TRUE)` will install `Rtools` for you automatically.
If not, [download](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) and install it manually.

**2.2 HTTP error 403**

```
HTTP error 403.
  API rate limit exceeded for xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx. (But here's the good news: Authenticated requests get a higher rate limit. Check out the documentation for more details.)

  Rate limit remaining: 0/60
  Rate limit reset at: 2026-01-21 07:58:19 UTC

  To increase your GitHub API rate limit
  - Use `usethis::create_github_token()` to create a Personal Access Token.
  - Use `gitcreds::gitcreds_set()` to add the token.
```

If so, following the instruction to create and set a Personal Access Token.
You need to have a GitHub account and `Git` installed locally as prerequisites.

## Important Note

`glycoverse` before v0.1.1 had serious bugs in dependency management.
We recommend all users to update to the latest version of `glycoverse`,
and call `glycoverse::glycoverse_update()` to update all the packages in the `glycoverse` ecosystem.

Besides, we are progressively uploading glycoverse packages to CRAN.
Every time a package is shifted to CRAN, we will update the `glycoverse` meta-package
to depend on the CRAN version of that package.
So come back from time to time to check if you have the latest version of `glycoverse`!

## Documentation

We have two case studies that showcase the basic workflow of `glycoverse`:

- [Case Study: Glycoproteomics](https://glycoverse.github.io/glycoverse/articles/case-study-1.html)
- [Case Study: Glycomics](https://glycoverse.github.io/glycoverse/articles/case-study-2.html)

Choose one of them to get started, and then refer to the documentation of the individual packages for more details.

## Usage

`library(glycoverse)` will load all the core packages in the `glycoverse` ecosystem:

```{r}
library(glycoverse)
```

This includes:

**Omics data analysis**

- [glyexp](https://glycoverse.github.io/glyexp/), for data management
- [glyread](https://glycoverse.github.io/glyread/), for data import
- [glyclean](https://glycoverse.github.io/glyclean/), for data cleaning and preprocessing
- [glystats](https://glycoverse.github.io/glystats/), for statistical analysis
- [glyvis](https://glycoverse.github.io/glyvis/), for data visualization

**Glycan structure analysis**

- [glyrepr](https://glycoverse.github.io/glyrepr/), for glycan structure representation
- [glyparse](https://glycoverse.github.io/glyparse/), for glycan structure parsing
- [glymotif](https://glycoverse.github.io/glymotif/), for glycan structure motif analysis
- [glydet](https://glycoverse.github.io/glydet/), for glycan derived trait analysis
- [glydraw](https://glycoverse.github.io/glydraw/), for glycan structure visualization

You can also install the non-core glycoverse packages if needed:

- [glyenzy](https://glycoverse.github.io/glyenzy/), for glycan biosynthesis pathway analysis
- [glydb](https://glycoverse.github.io/glydb/), for glycan database
- [glyanno](https://glycoverse.github.io/glyanno/), for glycan annotation
- [glysmith](https://glycoverse.github.io/glysmith/), for full analytical pipeline

You can get a situation report of all the packages in the `glycoverse` ecosystem with `glycoverse_sitrep()`:

```{r}
glycoverse_sitrep()
```

To list all dependencies of glycoverse core packages, run:

```{r}
glycoverse_deps(recursive = TRUE)  # recursive = TRUE to list dependencies of each package
```

And you can update all the packages with `glycoverse_update()`:

```r
glycoverse_update()
```
