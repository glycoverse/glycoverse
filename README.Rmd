The 'glycoverse' is a set of packages that together form a comprehensive pipeline for glycomics and glycoproteomics data analysis.
This package is designed to make it easy to install and load multiple 'glycoverse' packages in a single step.

## Installation

You can install the latest release of glycoverse core packages from [r-universe](https://glycoverse.r-universe.dev/glycoverse) with:

```r
install.packages('glycoverse', repos = c('https://glycoverse.r-universe.dev', 'https://cloud.r-project.org'))
```

Or from [GitHub](https://github.com/glycoverse/glycoverse):

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("glycoverse/glycoverse@*release")
```

Or install the development version (not recommended):

``` r
remotes::install_github("glycoverse/glycoverse")
```

Just like `tidyverse`, installing `glycoverse` automatically installs all glycoverse core packages
including `glyexp`, `glyread`, `glyclean`, `glystats`, `glyvis`, `glyrepr`, `glyparse`, `glymotif`, `glydet`, and `glydraw`.

You can also only install some of them manually if you don't want the whole repertoire.
For example:

```r
remotes::install_github("glycoverse/glymotif@*release")
```

Note that `glymotif` depends on `glyexp`, `glyrepr` and `glyparse`,
so these three packages will also be installed.

### Troubleshooting

We are scheduled to upload glycoverse packages to CRAN or Bioconductor. However, currently, many glycoverse packages (including this meta-package) must be installed from r-universe or GitHub.

Installing R packages from GitHub can sometimes be tricky due to compilation requirements or network limits. Below are solutions to common situations encountered by our users.

#### Quick Fix: Switch Installer

If you are using `pak` and it fails (currently `pak` may have issues building from source on some setups), try installing from `r-universe` or using the standard `remotes` approach:

``` r
# From r-universe
install.packages('glycoverse', repos = c('https://glycoverse.r-universe.dev', 'https://cloud.r-project.org'))

# From GitHub using `remotes`
remotes::install_github("glycoverse/package_name")
```

#### Common Errors & Solutions

##### 2.1 Compilation Tools Missing (Error: "Could not find tools...")

If you see an error mentioning `pkgbuild::check_build_tools`, it means your system lacks the necessary compilation tools.

Call `pkgbuild::check_build_tools(debug = TRUE)` to install it automatically.

Or [download](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) and install Rtools manually.

**macOS Users:** You likely need Xcode Command Line Tools.

Open your Terminal (not RStudio) and run: `xcode-select --install`.

##### 2.2 HTTP Error 403 (API Rate Limit Exceeded)

Error: `HTTP error 403. API rate limit exceeded for xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx.`

GitHub limits unauthenticated installation requests. To fix this:

1. Create a Personal Access Token (PAT) using `usethis::create_github_token()` (requires a GitHub account).
2. Add the token to your environment using `gitcreds::gitcreds_set()`.

##### 2.3 Network Timeout

If the download fails due to a slow connection (Timeout of 60 seconds was reached), increase the timeout limit in R before installing:

``` r
options(timeout = 600) # Set timeout to 10 minutes
remotes::install_github("glycoverse/package_name")
```

## Important Note

`glycoverse` before v0.1.1 had serious bugs in dependency management.
We recommend all users to update to the latest version of `glycoverse`,
and call `glycoverse::glycoverse_update()` to update all the packages in the `glycoverse` ecosystem.

Besides, we are progressively uploading glycoverse packages to CRAN or Bioconductor.
Every time a package is shifted to CRAN/Bioconductor, we will update the `glycoverse` meta-package
to depend on the CRAN/Bioconductor version of that package.
So come back from time to time to check if you have the latest version of `glycoverse`!

## Documentation

We have two case studies that showcase the basic workflow of `glycoverse`:

- [Case Study: Glycoproteomics](https://glycoverse.github.io/glycoverse/articles/case-study-1.html)
- [Case Study: Glycomics](https://glycoverse.github.io/glycoverse/articles/case-study-2.html)

Choose one of them to get started, and then refer to the documentation of the individual packages for more details.

## Usage

`library(glycoverse)` will load all the core packages in the `glycoverse` ecosystem:

```{r}
library(glycoverse)
```

This includes:

**Omics data analysis**

- [glyexp](https://glycoverse.github.io/glyexp/), for data management
- [glyread](https://glycoverse.github.io/glyread/), for data import
- [glyclean](https://glycoverse.github.io/glyclean/), for data cleaning and preprocessing
- [glystats](https://glycoverse.github.io/glystats/), for statistical analysis
- [glyvis](https://glycoverse.github.io/glyvis/), for data visualization

**Glycan structure analysis**

- [glyrepr](https://glycoverse.github.io/glyrepr/), for glycan structure representation
- [glyparse](https://glycoverse.github.io/glyparse/), for glycan structure parsing
- [glymotif](https://glycoverse.github.io/glymotif/), for glycan structure motif analysis
- [glydet](https://glycoverse.github.io/glydet/), for glycan derived trait analysis
- [glydraw](https://glycoverse.github.io/glydraw/), for glycan structure visualization

You can also install the non-core glycoverse packages if needed:

- [glyenzy](https://glycoverse.github.io/glyenzy/), for glycan biosynthesis pathway analysis
- [glydb](https://glycoverse.github.io/glydb/), for glycan database
- [glyanno](https://glycoverse.github.io/glyanno/), for glycan annotation
- [glysmith](https://glycoverse.github.io/glysmith/), for full analytical pipeline

You can get a situation report of all the packages in the `glycoverse` ecosystem with `glycoverse_sitrep()`:

```{r}
glycoverse_sitrep()
```

To list all dependencies of glycoverse core packages, run:

```{r}
glycoverse_deps(recursive = TRUE)  # recursive = TRUE to list dependencies of each package
```

And you can update all the packages with `glycoverse_update()`:

```r
glycoverse_update()
```
