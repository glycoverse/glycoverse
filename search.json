Just like integer() character(), glycan_structure() specialized vector type. software (like pGlyco3 StrucGP) outputs structural information text strings. import data using glyread, glyparse package automatically converts strings proper glycan_structure() vectors stores variable information tibble. Note software provides structural data—give compositions. Fortunately, example dataset includes structural information, opening world advanced analytical possibilities. Let’s explore motif analysis. Quick note: printed structures use IUPAC-condensed notation, ’ll also use defining motifs . Don’t worry looks intimidating—’ll include visual diagrams help. said, ’re planning serious structural analysis, learning IUPAC-condensed notation worth investment. Check guide get started—’s easier looks! Lewis antigen epitopes common structural motifs found N-glycans. Ignoring linkage specificity, can define three main Lewis motif families:  ’s express motifs IUPAC-condensed notation: couple important points: ’re using generic monosaccharide names (“Hex” vs. “Glc”) match typical glycoproteomics data resolution “??-?” represents unknown linkages—common limitation mass spectrometry data level structural ambiguity typical glycoproteomics. key matching motif definitions data’s resolution. ’s research question: many glycosites show differential Lewis antigen expression across conditions? Without glycoverse, nightmare tackle manually. Take moment imagine pain hand! Now, glycoverse solution: quantify_motifs() transforms data new experiment() object. Instead quantifying individual glycans per glycosite, now motif abundances per glycosite across samples. Since ’s still experiment() object, glystats functions work seamlessly—including gly_anova(). Now can answer question using standard tidyverse operations, since motif_anova_res$tidy_result$main_test just regular tibble: Want specific glycosites significant Lewis /x epitopes? Easy: ’s another common question: pathways enriched proteins carry Lewis /x epitopes? analysis, don’t need motif quantification—just need know proteins motifs. glymotif::add_motifs_lgl() perfect .  add_motifs_lgl() adds three new TRUE/FALSE columns (lewis_by, lewis_ax, sia_lewis_ax) variable information. filter_var() keeps glycoforms Lewis /x epitopes. Finally, gly_enrich_kegg() runs pathway enrichment remaining proteins. glymotif much offer beyond examples.
